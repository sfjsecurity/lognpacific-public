# LognPacific Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

## Overview

This repository documents hands-on cybersecurity exercises completed as part of the LognPacific program.

The objective of this lab portfolio is to demonstrate practical implementation across multiple security disciplines including:

• STIG compliance & secure configuration management  
• Vulnerability assessment & remediation  
• Threat hunting & investigative analysis  
• Detection engineering concepts  
• Security automation using PowerShell  

Each section of this repository reflects structured methodology, validation processes, and enterprise-aligned security practices.
